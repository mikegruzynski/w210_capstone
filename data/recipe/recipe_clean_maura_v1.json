Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Stir with a fork or the dough hook to make a shaggy dough.

If youre using a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook beat on high speed until the dough comes together and slaps the side of the bowl about 5 minutes adding up to 1/4 cup/30 grams more flour as needed to create a cohesive ball. Divide the dough half {for large pizzas} or quarters {for small pizzas} and form into balls. Place each ball of dough in a lightly oiled plastic bag seal and refrigerate overnight {it gets more supple as it sits overnight} or up to 3 days {or freeze for up to 1 week}. Remove the dough from the fridge 2 hours before you plan to cook. Oil two or four bowls {depending on whether you are making two large or four individual pizzas}. Turn each dough ball in the bowl to coat in oil; cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap/cling film. Draw a circle around the top to mark where the dough is now so you can watch it expand. Set aside in a warm place until doubled about 2 hours. Position a pizza stone on the bottom rack of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475\u00b0F/240\u00b0C/gas 9 at least 45 minutes before you plan to bake the pizzas. Lightly dust a clean countertop and the dough with flour. Press and pat each ball of dough into a rectangle or round. Once you have the basic shape you want stretch the dough by draping it over the back of your hands and wrists letting it hang down so gravity does the work. For larger pizzas aim for a 7-by-12-inch/17-by 30.5-cm rectangle or a 12-inch/30.5-cm round; for individual pizzas aim for a 6-to-9-inch/15-to-23-cm round or rectangle for smaller pizzas and flatbreads depending on how thick you like your dough. {Dont worry if its misshapen.} Cover the dough with a towel until baking. Generously dust a pizza peel or baking sheet/tray with cornmeal and lay on the dough shaking the peel or sheet/tray back and forth a little to make sure the dough slides easily. Chop or slice all the vegetables into small pieces that will cook quickly in the hot oven. Top the pizzas with any topping that needs to be cooked or melted like cheese sliced garlic mushrooms and small pieces of vegetables that need cooked through{the key is to use a light hand here since overtopped pizzas tend to turn soggy} dividing the toppings between all the dough. Slide the pizza onto the stone {or cook directly on the baking sheet} and bake larger pizzas one at a time smaller ones two at a time until puffed crisp and evenly baked through about 8 to 10 minutes.
