When starting the layers lay the eggplant down side by side covering the bottom of the pan. It is best to use 1/2 ounce mozzarella and a little bit of sauce on each eggplant piece to keep it moist.

Add more mozzarella to the top of the eggplant during the last 5 minutes of baking; it is a great way to avoid the cheese burn."]}}
